# Introduction
Data science combines multiple fields, including statistics, scientific methods, artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics, to extract value from data. Professionals who use data science are known as data scientists and apply a combination of diverse skills to analyze data collected from the web, smartphones, customers, sensors and other sources to generate actionable insights.

Data science includes the tasks of preparing data for analytics, such as cleaning, aggregating, and manipulating data for advanced data analytics. Analytic applications and data scientists can review the results to discover patterns and provides business leaders with informed insights.

# Data science: An undiscovered resource for machine learning
Data science is one of the most exciting fields out there today. 

## Why is it so important?

Because companies are sitting on a treasure trove of data. As modern technology has enabled the creation and storage of ever-increasing amounts of information, data volumes have increased. It is estimated that 90% of the world's data was created in the last two years. For example, Facebook users upload 10 million photos per hour.

But often this data is stored in databases and data lakes, mostly untouched. The vast amount of data collected and stored by these technologies can generate transformative benefits for organizations and societies around the world, but only if we know how to interpret it. That's where data science comes in.

Data science reveals trends and generates information that companies can use to make better decisions and create more innovative products and services. Perhaps most importantly, it enables machine learning models to extract insights from the vast amounts of data fed to them, thus avoiding reliance primarily on business analysts to see what they can discover from the data.

Data is the foundation of innovation, but its value comes from the information that data scientists can extract from it and then use.
